# Trapper Keeper

## Description

This project is a simple site built over 10 days in a team of 4. The site allows you to make notes or todo lists with a dynamic form the notes are saved to a back-end server made with Node.js. The user can then check off list items as completed and change the color of the notes. The user also has the ability to delete any note.

## Setup

Simply start by cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NimSum/trapper-keeper.git
```

In the same folder you cloned the repository also clone the back-end repository with 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BrennanDuffey/trapper-keeper-api.git
```

Once you have cloned the repo, to install the library dependencies cd into the folders just created and run:

```bash
npm install
```

First in the back-end folder run `npm start` in your terminal, you should see "Something is running on http://localhost:3000/".  Now opening a separate tab in the terminal cd into the front-end repository and run `npm start` you're default browser should open a tab to http://localhost:3001/ if not simply go to http://localhost:3001/ in your preferred browser.
